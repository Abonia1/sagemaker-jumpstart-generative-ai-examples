### Module 1: Stable Diffusion with Small Dataset of Cat Images
This repository showcases the Stable Diffusion technique, a powerful generative modeling technique that allows for the creation of high-quality images from small datasets. The repository consists of two Jupyter notebooks.

The first notebook, 01-txt2img-gen.ipynb, demonstrates how to easily create a SageMaker endpoint for the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model and generate cat images based on user prompts. Users can input fun scenarios and prompts to generate various cat images.

    <img src="./../img/cat-1.png" alt="Image 1" width="400" style="display:inline-block">
    <img src="./../img/cat-2.png" alt="Image 2" width="400" style="display:inline-block">
</div>

The second notebook, 02-finetune.ipynb, demonstrates how to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model using a small set of images, specifically images of cats. The model can learn to recreate the images of cats and re-impose them in various fun scenarios, allowing for a wide range of creative possibilities.

<div>
    <img src="./../img/cat-3.png" alt="Image 3" width="400" style="display:inline-block">
    <img src="./../img/cat-4.png" alt="Image 4" width="400" style="display:inline-block">
</div>

Overall, this repository provides users with a powerful tool for generating high-quality images, even with limited datasets. The Stable Diffusion technique offers a versatile and efficient way to create customized and imaginative images.
